# Coding Quiz

## Can you get all the questions right?

This project was to create an online quiz highlighting the use of Javascript (js).

 The quiz will load a pre-loaded set of questions and award a highscore based on the time remaining on the clock. When an answer is selected, it will show if the response for correct. If it was not, it will show the correct answer. Wrong answers deplete the remaiing time. 

 When all answer have been answer, or time has run out, the user will be asked to enter their name to be listed on the scoreboard. Highscores are saved locally and can be accessed from the scoreboard either at the end of the quiz or from the main screen.
